                                <p>Nathan Ladner began his career as a NETA electrical testing technician, testing, commissioning, and maintaining medium- and high-voltage systems nationwide. He then advanced into precision calibration and dielectric testing, serving as a calibration technician and acquiring extensive hands-on technical experience in torque tools, pressure and vacuum gauges, dimensional instruments, multimeters, and dielectric testing of rubber insulating gloves, sleeves, blankets, and live-line tools.</p>
                                <p>For four consecutive years he served as Director of Calibration Services for one of the Southeast's fastest-growing laboratories, doubling revenue or more each year while leading every aspect of the business—technical, sales, financial, and operational.</p>
                                <p>For the last two years he served as Director for a leading PPE manufacturer, where he designed and developed next-generation products and pioneered industry-first plasma surface modification and coating technologies that dramatically extend the service life of rubber insulating goods without compromising electrical performance or worker safety.</p>
                                <p>Today, as Co-Owner & Founder of Copperhead Labs, Nathan combines field-proven technical expertise, rare design-level understanding of rubber PPE performance and longevity, proven leadership, and a demonstrated ability to rapidly scale technical businesses.</p>

                            <p class="team-bio-preview">Kirk Crupi rose from part-time technician to owner by mastering every facet of calibration labs and rubber PPE operations.</p>

                            <div class="team-bio-full" id="bio-kirk">
                                <p>Kirk Crupi started in the calibration industry part-time while still in high school, quickly moved to full-time technician, and chose a hands-on career in the field over college. He progressed steadily through part-time technician, full-time technician, lead technician, operations lead, operations manager, and ultimately to owner, mastering every level of laboratory and field operations along the way. In his early years as a technician alone he personally tested and inspected more than 1,100 insulated bucket trucks and over 8,000 sets of rubber insulating gloves and sleeves.</p>
                                <p>As Operations Manager for one of the Southeast's fastest-growing calibration laboratories, Kirk strengthened client relationships, elevated service standards, and drove consistent growth. At the same time he served as Operations Manager for a leading electrical PPE manufacturer, a demanding dual-responsibility role he held for nine months. This rare overlap gave him comprehensive insight into both the testing and calibration side and the manufacturing and design side of rubber insulating goods, from raw-material selection and production to real-world performance and end-user requirements.</p>
                                <p>Known throughout the industry for forging strong, lasting partnerships and running highly efficient operations, Kirk lives by the motto "If a customer asks if we can do it, never say no." Even as co-owner he continues to mentor newer technicians and stays hands-on in the lab and in the field every week.</p>
                                <p>Today, as Co-Owner and Founder of Copperhead Labs, Kirk brings battle-tested technical expertise earned at every rung of the ladder, a unique dual perspective on PPE manufacturing and testing, proven leadership from technician to owner, and an unrelenting client-first mindset that turns every request into a delivered solution.</p>
